#### Hello there!
These are my developing dotfiles. This is a work in progress and many commits are expected.
My goal is to **gather/alter/create** configuration files for a simple but elegant exprience.
The dotfiles are aimed to X11 systems, but many components would also work with Wayland.

##### Main Utilities:
<details>
    <ul>
        <summary> Components: *(Arch package names)* </summary>
        <li> Window Managers: **qtile** is my basic focus, Trials for bspwm & sxhkd are also present. </li>
        <li> Compositor: For systems on X11, where compositor is needed, **picom** does the job. </li>
        <li> Shell: **zsh & omyzsh**. </li> 
        <li> Terminal: **kitty**, alternatively **alacritty & tmux** are adviced. </li>
        <li> Editor: **neovim** is adviced, for automated configuration try AstroVim. </li>
        <li> File Manager: **vifm** is a good enough terminal based file manager. <br/>
             For a GUI file manager any of: **nemo, thunar, pacman-fm** is more than fine. </li> 
        <li> Notifications: **dunst** is more than adequate. Alternatively deadd looks promising. </li>
        <li> System Tray: **blueman, network-manager-applet, pasystray**. A brightness applet may be advised. </li>
        <li> Images: **feh** and **graphicsmagick** will suffice most of the basic needs. </li>
        <li> Screenshots: On arch based systems, **shotgun** and **hacksaw** are adviced, elsewhere **maim** is available. <br/>
             **Flameshot** is also an easier option. For the time none of the above seem to work well with Wayland. </li>
        <li> X11 System utilities: **numlockx, xorg-xrandr, xorg-xsetroot, xorg-xrdb**. </li>
        <li> Diagnostics: **bottom** or **btop**, **lm_sensors, inxi** are good general utilities. </li>
        <li> Polkit: Any will exactly the same, **polkit-gnome** is a good gtk one. </li>
        <li> Theming: **lxappearance-gtk3** will automate most of the work. </li>
        <li> Other utilities: *git, openssh, gparted, dosfstools, ntfs-3g, fuse3, fuse2, fuse-common, man-pages,
             tldr, networkmanager, wpa_supplicant* </li>
        <li> To be added: **rofi**. </li>
    </ul>
