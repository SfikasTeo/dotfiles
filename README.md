#### Hello there!
These are my developing dotfiles. This is a work in progress and many commits are expected.
My goal is to </b>gather/alter/create</b> configuration files for a simple but elegant exprience.
The dotfiles are aimed to X11 systems, but many components would also work with Wayland.  

Even though this repository might not be the perfect place, i will also include some small 
tutorials and documentation on some basic utilities for my convenience.

##### Main Utilities:
<details>
    <summary> Components: <i>(Arch package names)</i> </summary>
    <ul>
        <li> Window Managers: <b>qtile</b> is my basic focus. Older bspwm & sxhkd configs are also present. </li>
        <li> Compositor: For systems on X11, where compositor is needed, <b>picom</b> does the job. </li>
        <li> Shell: <b>zsh & omyzsh</b>. </li> 
        <li> Terminal: <b>kitty</b>, alternatively <b>alacritty & tmux</b> are adviced. </li>
        <li> Editor: <b>neovim</b> is adviced, for automated configuration try AstroVim. </li>
        <li> File Manager: <b>vifm</b> is a good enough terminal based file manager. <br/>
             For a GUI file manager any of: <b>nemo, thunar, pacman-fm</b> is more than fine. </li> 
        <li> Notifications: <b>dunst</b> is more than adequate. Alternatively deadd looks promising. </li>
        <li> System Tray: <b>blueman, network-manager-applet, pasystray</b>. A brightness applet may be advised. </li>
        <li> Images: <b>feh</b> and <b>graphicsmagick</b> will suffice most of the basic needs. </li>
        <li> Screenshots: On arch based systems, <b>shotgun</b> and <b>hacksaw</b> are adviced, elsewhere <b>maim</b> is available. <br/>
             <b>Flameshot</b> is also an easier option. For the time none of the above seem to work well with Wayland. </li>
        <li> X11 System utilities: <b>numlockx, xorg-xrandr, xorg-xsetroot, xorg-xrdb</b>. </li>
        <li> Diagnostics: <b>bottom</b> or <b>btop</b>, <b>lm_sensors, inxi</b> are good general utilities. </li>
        <li> Polkit: Any will exactly the same, <b>polkit-gnome</b> is a good gtk one. </li>
        <li> Theming: <b>lxappearance-gtk3</b> will automate most of the work. </li>
        <li> Other utilities: <i>git, openssh, gparted, dosfstools, ntfs-3g, fuse3, fuse2, fuse-common, man-pages,
             tldr, networkmanager, wpa_supplicant</i>. </li>
        <li> To be added: <b>rofi</b>. </li>
    </ul>
</details>
